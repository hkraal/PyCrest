## Contributing

All help is more than welcome! If you're looking for a way to contribute feel free to raise an issue or create a pull-request and keep PyCrest alive.

To prevent the project from dying out again I created an organisation enabling multiple people to manage this repository so it doesn't depend on a single person.
